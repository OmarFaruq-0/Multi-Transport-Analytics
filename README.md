# Multi-Transport-Analytics
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on building an integrated data analytics and AI-driven dashboard for a multi-transport network encompassing flights, buses, and trains. The goal is to transform raw operational, financial, and customer data into actionable insights that enhance 

profitability, efficiency, and decision-making.

The system analyzes sales, operations, costs, and customer behavior using tools like SQL, Excel, and Power BI, ensuring seamless data integrity across platforms. Key objectives include tracking revenue growth, identifying underperforming routes, optimizing resource 

utilization, forecasting future trends, and improving passenger satisfaction.

The project is structured into four major analytical pillars:

A. Sales & Revenue Analytics: Evaluates total and route-level revenues, profit margins, and trends over time.

B. Operational Efficiency: Measures trip delays, costs, occupancy rates, and maintenance efficiency to reduce losses.

C. Financial & Cost Analytics: Assesses cost structures, ROI, and fuel price impacts to ensure sustainable operations.

D. Customer & Marketing Analytics: Analyzes passenger behavior, ticket pricing, feedback, and campaign performance to boost engagement and retention.

The final deliverable includes an interactive AI-powered dashboard that automatically updates daily KPIs such as revenue, occupancy rate, and costs, supported by predictive forecasting and automated data cleaning workflows (via Python or n8n).
